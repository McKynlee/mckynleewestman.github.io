     <h2 class="bold underline">PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
     <p>Former bicycle-tour-guide-in-Italy turned full stack software developer. 
       I am still as particular about my pasta as I am about the organization of my code! 
       Past teams have chosen me as a leader; I have a lot of empathy and embrace feedback as a way for me and my teammates to grow.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Users may follow two paths:</li>
        <li>Learners register, select an instructor with whom to pair, regularly complete language challenges which they can 
          have the website read aloud for them in native Spanish (!!), and receive tailored feedback from their instructor.</li>
        <li>Instructors register, set a limit for how many learners they would like to be paired with (this limit is protected 
          by the application), review challenge submissions from their learners and leave each of them tailored feedback.</li>
        <li>I built this application with React, Redux, Redux-Sagas, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, Lorem Picsum API and JS Web Speech API.</li>
